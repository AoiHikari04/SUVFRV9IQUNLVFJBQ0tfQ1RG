# 🎉 CTF Competition Solutions & Wrap-up 🎉

## 🏆 Thank You for Participating! 🏆

We sincerely thank you for joining our Capture The Flag (CTF) competition. We hope you learned a lot and enjoyed solving the challenges! Your dedication and skill were impressive.

This repository serves as the official archive, containing all the flags, solution scripts, and detailed write-ups for every challenge presented in the competition.

## 🚩 Quick Start Guide (The Original Challenge)

Here’s a quick reminder of the objective during the competition:

1. **Objective:** The goal was to find the hidden "flags" throughout the challenges. A flag was a unique string of text, typically formatted like: `CTF{this_is_your_flag}`.
    
2. **Submit:** Flags were submitted on the competition platform (e.g., the scoreboard website) to earn points.
    
3. **Challenges:** Challenges were categorized by type (e.g., Web, Crypto, Pwn, Reversing).
    
4. **Scoring:** Points were awarded per flag, often decreasing in value as more teams solved them (dynamic scoring).
